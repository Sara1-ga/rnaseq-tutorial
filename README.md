# nf-core/rnaseq tutorial

## Welcome

These pages are a tutorial workshop for the [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io) pipeline [nf-core/rnaseq](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq).

In this workshop, we will recap ---- TO DO -------

Please note that this is not an introductory workshop, and we will assume some basic familiarity with Nextflow.

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

- understand the key concepts behind RNAseq differential expression analysis, as adopted in this pipeline
- analyse simple NGS datasets with the nf-core/rnaseq workflow 
- customise some of its features for your own analyses
- integrate different sources of information to interpret the results

Let's get started!
