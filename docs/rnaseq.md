## Overview

![rnaseq overview](./img/nf-core-rnaseq_metro_map_grey.png)

## Experimental Design



### Library design


### Reference genome


### Input files


## Running nf-core/rnaseq


### Reference and annotation files



### Computing resources

Based on the choices we made when starting up the gitpod environment, we recommend to use the following additional parameters.
They can also be added to the parameters directive in the config file we just edited.

```groovy
params {
    max_cpus                  = 2
    max_memory                = '6.5GB'
    max_time                  = '2.h'
    use_annotation_cache_keys = true
}
```


### Filtering parameters



### Launching the pipeline

Now we are ready to launch the pipeline, and we can use the following command line:

```bash

```
