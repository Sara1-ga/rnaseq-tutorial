# Diffential Analysis with DESeq2


## Launching the RStudio environment

Once the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline is terminated, the resulting data are stored in the folder results_star_salmon. No we can analyze the results by running DESeq2 on RStudio. First of all, we need to launch it by typing:

```bash
sudo rstudio-server start
```

A pop-up will appear and by clicking on "Open", we will be redirected to the RStudio login page. By inserting the username and the password reported below, we will be able to connect to RStudio.

```bash
Username: gitpod
Password: pass
```

Now we are ready to performed the differential expression analysis.
